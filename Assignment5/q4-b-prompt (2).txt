You are playing a game of tic-tac-toe on a 5x5 board. The current state of the board is:

X | O | X |   |  
----------------
  | O |   |   |  
----------------
  |   | X |   |  
----------------
  |   |   |   |  
----------------
  |   |   |   |  

It's your turn to make a move. You are playing as X.
Note: The top row is the row 1 and then 2 and 3, etc. And also the top left column
is column 1 and then 2 and 3, etc.
Enter the row and column numbers where you want to place your X as your best next move (e.g., "1 2").

Strategy of Computer:
Win or Block: The computer first tries to win or block the player's winning
 move by simulating the move and checking if it results in a win.
Fill Own Line: If it can't win or block, the computer tries to fill its own row, column,
 or diagonal where it has already placed one symbol and there is no symbol of the other player. 
This is done by counting the number of computer symbols and ensuring no player symbols are present in the line.
Random Move: If none of the above conditions are met, the computer makes a random move in an empty cell.
